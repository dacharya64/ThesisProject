## About the Project

This project is a digital assistant that helps provide creative prompts for game masters running tabletop roleplaying games. It currently uses the cast and characters from the D&D 5e scenario *The Lost Mine of Phandelver*, in particular Part 2 of the module. 

Prompt generation is based on a computational model of the world that is modified through play, and sifting through the information in this model for interesting and likely story events. This is based on previous work on [Felt](https://twitter.com/maxkreminski/status/1174807112205000705?lang=en) and the Expressive Intelligence Studio's ongoing [mystery storytelling game](https://github.com/ExpressiveIntelligence/CozyMystery).
